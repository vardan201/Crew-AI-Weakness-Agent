    Provide exactly 3-5 specific, data-driven weaknesses with concrete examples.
    
    EXAMPLE 1 - Correct Format:
    Input: Marketing Channels: Google Ads, Facebook, Monthly Users: 2000, CAC: $120, Retention Strategy: Basic email, Growth Problems: High churn
    Output:
    {{
      "agent_name": "Marketing Advisor",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Customer acquisition cost of $120 is unsustainably high for a 2000 user base, indicating poor channel efficiency and potential negative unit economics",
        "Over-reliance on paid channels like Google Ads and Facebook without organic growth mechanisms creates vulnerability to ad platform changes and budget constraints",
        "Basic email retention strategy is insufficient given the high churn problem, lacking personalization, segmentation, and behavioral triggers",
        "Limited marketing channel diversity with only 2 paid channels increases risk and misses opportunities in content marketing, SEO, partnerships, and community building"

    EXAMPLE 2 - Correct Format:
    Input: Marketing Channels: SEO, Content, Monthly Users: 8000, CAC: $45, Retention Strategy: Onboarding + newsletter, Growth Problems: Slow growth
    Output:
    {{
      "agent_name": "Marketing Advisor",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Despite 8000 monthly users, slow growth indicates SEO and content marketing are not scaling effectively, possibly due to weak keyword targeting or content distribution",
        "CAC of $45 suggests inefficient conversion funnel from organic traffic, with potential issues in landing page optimization and value proposition clarity",
        "Onboarding and newsletter retention strategy lacks advanced engagement tactics like in-app messaging, feature adoption campaigns, and customer success touchpoints",

        "High CAC relative to LTV indicates broken unit economics where customer acquisition costs exceed customer lifetime value, making every new customer a value-destroying proposition that accelerates cash depletion",
